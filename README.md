Adding CC .raw files. Please set it on "(your steam file)\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo".

## Version 1.1.x
###### v1.1.0
Adding rtv-z(rtv3).

There are 2 versions: .1x and FyS. FyS is different from .1x in having HP and CC.

You can change which version will play in adminroom. Try to type "setpos 0 0 -1800" in your CLIENT console. Then the third LEFT side from the front of "RTV" is the .1x version and the RIGHT side is the FyS version.

Decreasing rtv-fys difficulty.
