# Grau-Stripper
This stripper will add extra rtv levels.

Any stripper makers will not publish their own stripper, so I remade rtv levels and publish MY own stripper.
I tried to reproduce original one as much as I can but sometimes I made mistakes.
So if you find mistakes or glitches, contact to Contrapasso#5417(discord) or this github.
If you change this file name to "ze_grau_a03_4ff.cfg", you can play these rtv levels in ze_grau_a03_4ff.
